# Coding-Sample
Hi, I'm Yuqi. Here are some coding samples editted from my previous projects. The contents of files are as below:

MAPplot_R.R: A map plot using geographic shape file and artificially generated dataset, using R.
PDFtoDATASET_R.R: Converting text in pdf files to excel or dta file.
Replication_Stata.do: A replication project from importing raw data (initially in ACSII format) to replicating of tables in article.
Replication_Result.pdf: [READ THIS SAVES YOUR TIME!] The pdf file illustrate how I replicate the paper, including main results and comparisons between original results and relication as well as important sections of the code. It's a summary of the dofile with explicit results.

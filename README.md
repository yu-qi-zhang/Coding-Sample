# Coding-Sample
Hi, I'm Yuqi. Here are some coding samples editted from my previous projects. The contents of files are as below:

1. MAPplot_1.R: A map plot using geographic shape file and artificially generated dataset, using R; the result could be seen directly in MAPplot_1.png

2. TEXTtoDATA_2.R: Extracting data from text in pdf files, basic cleaning and exporting as excel or dta file.

3. Replication_Stata_3.do: A replication project of an empirical paper using raw data (initially in ACSII format), including basic cleaning, descriptive statistics and regression tables.

   Replication_Result_3.pdf: [READING THIS SAVES TIME!] The pdf file illustrate how I replicate the paper, including main results and comparisons between original results and replication as well as important sections of the code. It's a summary of the dofile with explicit results.

5. ABMsimulation_4.m: Code to replicate an agent-based model paper using MATLAB; the numerical simulation result could be seen directly in ABMsimulation_4.png

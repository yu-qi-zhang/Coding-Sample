# Coding-Sample
Hi, I'm Yuqi. Here are some coding samples editted from my previous projects. The contents of files are as below:

1. MAPplot_1.R: A map plot using geographic shape file and artificially generated dataset, using R.

2. PDFtoDATASET_2.R: Converting text in pdf files to excel or dta file.

3. Replication_Stata_3.do: A replication project from importing raw data (initially in ACSII format) to replicating of tables in article.

   Replication_Result_3.pdf: [READING THIS SAVES YOUR TIME!] The pdf file illustrate how I replicate the paper, including main results and comparisons between original results and replication as well as important sections of the code. It's a summary of the dofile with explicit results.

5. ABMsimulation_4.m: Code to replicate a agent-based model paper using MATLAB; the numerical simulation result could be seen directly ABMsimulation_4.png
